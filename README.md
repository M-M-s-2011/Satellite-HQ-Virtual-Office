# ðŸš€Satellite HQ: Virtual OfficeðŸš€

Satellite HQ is virtual office simulator powered by Phaser and WebRTC.

## Start Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm run start-dev`

Launches the app on localhost:8080!

To interact with others in this virtual environment, move close to another avatar and click the "join video" button. If they press the button on their end, you'll find yourselves on a live video call. You can also use the office-wide chat to post public memos to everyone currently in the office. (Run the app in two tabs to test it out on your own!)
